# Welcome
Hello! This is the **PyFileCopy** tool.
# Libraries
There is only one. It's called pycopier.shutil. To install the package, open the console and type in this:
```console
pip --install pycopier
```
Probably the package name will be incorrect, so you can correct me in the comments.

Okay, bye! I will update this introduction more soon so you can understand more of PyFileCopy.
Bye! See you soon!
